## Conclusion

While significant progress has been made on the design system foundation, the core functionality of the application still needs substantial work. The most critical issues are the wallet connection and page crashes, which must be resolved before proceeding with other features.

The portfolio page, being the core of the application, should be the primary focus after fixing critical issues. Once the portfolio functionality is complete, the focus can shift to analytics, protocols, and advanced features.

Estimated time to complete all remaining work: 4-6 weeks with dedicated development.
