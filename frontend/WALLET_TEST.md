# Manual Wallet Connection Test

## Quick Test Steps

1. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3002 (or http://localhost:3000)

2. Look for the "Connect Wallet" button in the header (top right)

3. Click the "Connect Wallet" button

4. **Expected Result**: A modal should appear with the title "Connect Your Wallet" and show wallet options:
   - Phantom
   - Solflare  
   - Ledger
   - Torus

## What Was Fixed

The `WalletConnectModal` component was missing from the `WalletButton` component. It has been restored at line 494 of `/components/wallet/WalletButton.tsx`.

## Verification

Run this command to confirm the fix is in place:
```bash
grep -n "WalletConnectModal" components/wallet/WalletButton.tsx
```

You should see:
- Line 6: import statement
- Line 494: component being rendered

## If It's Still Not Working

1. Check browser console for errors (F12 -> Console tab)
2. Make sure the dev server is running: `pnpm run dev:check`
3. Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
4. Clear browser cache and try again
